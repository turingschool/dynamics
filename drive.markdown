# Drive

What's the difference between when you enjoy your work and when you don't?
There's some common sense that we want work to be easy, but is that the case?
Why do we keep going? How do we get the best out of the people we're working
with?

## Daniel Pink & Motivation (20 Minutes)

Daniel Pink has written [a great book "Drive"](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438611264&sr=8-1&keywords=drive) and given a [TED Talk turned
into an animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) that you may have seen before.

Today we're going to watch one of his newer but related talks, [The Puzzle of Motivation](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation?language=en).

## Write (20 Minutes)

Pull up a text file or, if you're so bold, a blog post and consider
the questions below. Please consume the entire 20 minutes with writing.

1. When do you hit your most unconscious flow, where your actions happen almost
automatically?
2. Are there any dangers, problems, or weaknesses with that flow state? Is it
healthy?
3. What motivates you to work? Why are you here at Turing, in the big picture,
and why are you here *today* in the small?
4. What's the purpose behind your motivation? We all have a need for survival,
but you likely aspire to leave some kind of mark. What is it? Why?
5. What undercuts your motivation? When do you struggle to focus or achieve?
What excuses do you use to make it ok to fail or procrastinate?
6. What helps you do your best work? Why not do these things all the time?

## Discuss (20 Minutes)

For our last section let's get together in groups of three and discuss the questions
below. Spend the last five minutes on the final question.

1. Who is someone from your cohort who stands out for their motivation and focus?
Why? What are they able to do that other's won't or can't?
2. Describe your most successful team experience from the past three years. What
made it click? Were there any obstacles overcome? Why did it end?
3. Imagine your discussion group suddenly becomes a project team. What would be your first impressions / thoughts / fears about each other? If you have three people (A, B, C), have Person A describe Person B,
B describe C, and C describe A.
4. What have been your worst collaborative experiences so far at Turing? Why?
Was motivation an issue? Fear? Communication? What could have been done
differently? If motivation, what would lead to someone losing motivation?
5. What actions or patterns have led to your most successful collaborations here?
Are those replicable? Dive deeper than just saying you "clicked." Why did you
click? What made your gaps fit their weaknesses, and vice versa?
6. Imagine three three of you are the policy setters for all student work. What
are the five most important rules for successful (IE motivated, focused, productive)
teams?
