# Good Ideas

In the startup world there are a lot of mantras. Some of them include:

* "Fail fast."
* "Move fast and break things."

Why don't we have sayings like:

* "Get it right the first time."
* "Be successful."

That's weird. Maybe we should adopt a new principle:

* "Take and existing good idea and make a just-tiny-enough change to get VC funding."

Let's practice!

## Materials

* 3 large poster papers per group
* 1 set of markers per group

## Protocol

You have 12 minutes to:

* Break into groups of four
* Take one sheet of paper and, as a group, brainstorm 10 terrible "startup mashups"
* Pick the one that causes the most severe eye-roll
* Take your second sheet of paper and create the "pitch" for your product including:
  * a name
  * a tagline
  * maybe a logo
  * some ridiculous financial projections about the size of your market and your company's growth potential
  * a 45-second commercial that'll convince us to buy your product

After the 12 minutes we'll gather back together and share your products/pitches.

*What's a startup-mashup*?

* Uber for Petting Cats
* Tinder for Accountants
* AirBnB for Airplane Seats

It should be silly, ridiculous, but still mindful/kind to our community and the folks around it :)
